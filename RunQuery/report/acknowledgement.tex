We would like to extend our thanks to Prof. Jeffrey Ullman who guided us throughout the course of the project and his suggestions and obervations were key to building system from scratch. We also thank the entire 341 course staff, Prof. Jure Leskovec, Prof. Anand Rajaraman and Robi, for providing us with the opportunity and framework to work on this very interesting and challening project.
