   Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and people are not the only ones who need some love!             
                                                 Dogs Deserve Better        , a national organization that works toward freeing all dogs from being  chained or penned all day in yards, is celebrating "Have a Heart for  Chained Dogs Week," Feb. 7-14.     
   They collected valentines to  distribute to owners who don't understand why it's cruel and dangerous  to leave a dog chained up and isolated all day, away from people and other dogs.                                                                     The valentines    , most written and drawn by children, are supposed to be  given to the dogs as a loving gesture to show they are not forgotten or  unloved.     
   Dogs  Deserve Better has spread across the country and is changing laws to  stop chaining and penning. One amazing thing about this organization is  their new headquarters is located at the  Good Newz Rehab Center in Smithfield, Va. That is Michael Vick's Old Compound, where dozens of pit bulls were rescued a few years ago!     
   It went  into foreclosure and was bought by this compassionate group of  rescuers. The new address is 1915 Moonlight Road, Smithfield, Va. 23430.  Their new phone is 757-357-9292. Check out the rescued dogs available across the country.     
                                                                                                                                                                                           Save-a-Pet in  Grayslake              also has 2012 "Hearts for Hearts" Virtual Valentine Giving  Campaign that represent actual needs of the dogs and cats at their  shelter. Contributions help provide food, medical care and healing  for the rescued pets at the no-kill shelter.     
           Truman's Story:               
   I  am 9 years old, and I spent years with my family inside and I was a  happy guy. I had a fenced-in yard and a canine buddy to run around and  be silly.     
   Then a move to a new home without a fenced-in play yard and  allergies of their son meant I was now no longer able to stay inside the  house. I was either now spending my time in the yard (but I would  sometimes run through the electric fence) or in the garage.     
   I got very  sad and started to stress out because all I wanted was to be inside the  house with them. I got some hot spots and even started chewing on my  tail. I could also sense they were close by and would bark in order to  get their attention.     
   I know sit, down and paw and love playing fetch  although my favorite thing is really spending time with my family. I am  great with kids, even small ones but can sometimes topple them over in  my eagerness. I would be perfect for an active family that would love to  have me tag along when they are out and about.

For example: $1 actually feeds me for an  entire day. $7 feeds me for a whole week. $12 pays for my heartworm  prevention medicine for a whole month and will help keep me healthy  until someone takes me home!     
   I appreciate whatever you can give to help  Save-A-Pet take care of me! Thank you so much, and I hope we can meet  soon!

   Registered voters in Lake County may  now request an official  application for a mail-in ballot for the March 20 primary election.     
   Illinois law requires each person voting by mail to complete an   application for ballot before each election. Once the signed application   is received, a ballot can be mailed to the voter.     
   For faster service, print the online application at                                                                                                                                                                                                                     LakeVoterPower.info     and mail to Lake County Clerk, Rm. 101, 18 N. County St., Waukegan, IL   60085. The web application is a fillable form to print, sign and date   before mailing.     
   Applications for ballot may also be requested by calling 847-377-2406 or emailing                                                 VotingByMail@lakecountyil.gov     to have the form sent by mail. Those choosing to vote by mail can visit                                                                                                                                                                                                                     LakeVoterPower.info     and use the "Track My Ballot" option to confirm their voted ballot has   been received by the office of Lake County Clerk Willard Helander.  Voted ballots must be returned to  the Clerk's office with a postmark no  later than March 19, the day prior  to Election Day.     
   Voters  may make a one-time request for this primary or enroll in a  Voting by  Mail Program to automatically receive an application for  ballot for each  election specified. Voters remain enrolled until the  clerk receives  notification to cancel or the voter's registration  becomes inactive.

   Today you will have the power to help families, children and individuals find vital services they need—or the most rewarding experience of their lives.     
   No, we haven’t started writing horoscopes—February is National                                                 2-1-1     Day and                                                                                                you can help spread the word    .     
   2-1-1 is a free helpline that offers health and human service information, referrals, assessments, crisis and other support between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Translation services are available in 250 languages.     
   “We        make sure you get the information you need in the most efficient and compassionate manner,” said        Chris Ashman, United Way 2-1-1 Policy Board Chair, at a recognition ceremony for 2-1-1 partners on Friday.     
   By    dialing 2-1-1     or visiting the                                                            ww.hudson211.org         database you can get access to assistance with preventing your home from foreclosure; filing your tax return; help with your heating bill; health or child care, legal help as well as support during disasters and emergency situations that don’t require an immediate response from the fire, ambulance or police departments (that’s what 9-1-1 is for!).       
   The service also helps community members, who want to give back, to find volunteer and other opportunities, like becoming adoptive parents.     
   “Every day people are in need and aren’t sure where to find answers,” said Pat Anderson Hudson Valley’s 2-1-1 Outreach Emergency Management Director, in a press release. “Whether it be tax assistance or a national emergency, 2-1-1 is available 12 hours a day, 365 days a year to get people the help they need as quickly as possible.      
   The free and confidential helpline was started in 2005— to assist the Hudson Valley region during the aftermath of Hurricane Katina—now offers its services to 92 percent, or 17.5 million, of New Yorkers in the Hudson Valley and Adirondacks/North Country.     
   There were about 190,000 who used the 2-1-1 helpline in 2010 and 394,00 who have searched the website since 2009.                                                                                    United Way of Westchester and Putnam     in White Plains serves as the lead agency for the 2-1-1 system, and was where the ceremony was held.      
   According to Westchester County Deputy County Executive Kevin Plunkett, the United Way of Westchester and Putnam, who serves as the lead agency for the 2-1-1 system, was open for three straight days after Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irene hit the Hudson Valley.      
   “All of us have to work for what is best for the people in our communities,” said Westchester County Deputy County Executive Kevin Plunkett on Thursday. “It’s a positive thing for the quality of life in our communities.”     
   The 2-1-1 program is funded through United Way grants as well as corporate foundations, and municipal grants and contracts

   Marlborough may see 1 to 3 inches of snow over the weekend, according to the                                                                                                                                                                                      National Weather Service    .     
   NWS has issued a Hazardous Weather Outlook for the area with rain and snow showers expected Friday night and steady snow on Saturday. The steady snow should taper off by 5 p.m. Saturday and then snow showers are expected Saturday night.     
   The snowy conditions will be joined by fog and winds that may exceed 20 mph.     
   NWS said there is a “moderate to high probability that winter weather advisories will be needed for a portion of southern New England.”     
   The heaviest snowfall should hit southeastern Massachusetts, but NWS warned that a shift in the storm track could result in changes in the type of precipitation and amount.

   Dear                                                                                      District 308     School Board members,         
   I'm writing this letter in hopes that the school board will carefully review the recommendation by the boundary committee and see the error in sending Homestead to Murphy Junior High next year.      
   I have no doubts that it will be a wonderful and successful school, my issue is with the distance it is from my house.  Why the committee chose to send Homestead to Murphy is still beyond me.  Wolfs Crossing boarders the Grande Park boundary and is closer than our children.      
   I have often heard the reasoning that they share a campus with Bednarcik and they have to keep that bond.  Building those two schools next to each other was a matter of making maximum use out of the property the district had purchased not some promise that they will always be together.      
   Every other elementary is forced to move onto the next level of their education in a building not too far away why should they be exempt from that process?  Our district like most in this state is short on funding.  Every dollar counts when you are trying to get the most out of what is available.      
   Just as your board decided to build additions to our high schools versus opening a new school and incurring more debt, I ask you to look at the dollars spent in this case.  Granted all three school options up for the potential move to Murphy are close, but if you look at the map we are not the obvious choice to be shipped from the most north east corner to the most south east corner.      
   Why does it make sense to ship our children down to Murphy past Bednarcik when they are sending kids north to Bednarcik from the Wolfs Crossing boundary?      
   Our group has asked several times for the dollar difference on these runs and have been not given the information.  Another large concern for me is the crowding on these buses.      
   According to your transportation data provided: A current bus capacity is 72 per the bus builders, Oswego's recommendation for kids grade  6-8 is 50.  If you look at the current routes only a very few are below 50, some as high as 66.  Kids are sitting three to a seat.      
   It is ridiculous to think that our kids will be on the bus 45 minutes each way like that. Wolfs Crossing is an area of future growth we are not.  The last thing we need to do is move these kids again in a couple years back to where they started from.         
   My hope is that you will ask the boundary committee for more than one option.  Do a full cost analysis on these options.  Provide a open forum where we can ask questions not just give comments.          
   Thank you for your time and consideration.

   Any way you look at it - the numbers don't make sense with regard to a variety of issues in this boundary discussion.  That's not limited to the Homestead situation.  Sadly, District 308s handling of so many things belongs in a "What Not To Do" handbook for other school districts.    

   It is strange to have failed to have an open forum where people can get answers to questions.  The final presentation of the boundary proposal was admittedly not the place - but clearly, the process missed a step.  When a large percentage of your taxes go to the school system, you deserve answers.  They may not be answers that you like, but you at least deserve to get your questions answered.

    would allow elementary students to remain at their current schools and attend the expected Junior high. Feedback indicates that process of implementation, complexity and amount of effort required would be extensive. It would resolve all the anger over schools, free up classrooms at the elementary level and open Murphy in a way (annexed) that would be considered generally fair. Junior high would be tight but could be accommodated by offering sections at the grade schools, where several classrooms open up.) Only high school boundaries would be affected by adding a third. Should be an annex to provide to allow for shared facilities and limit rivalry. As specific high school facilities are added, it can become it's "own". Research regarding shifting 5th to JH and 8th to HS seems to be positive, indicating higher potential for student growth. Implementation is challenging, however would be less controversial, changes to schools would be fewer, (except those that would go to Murphy as a high school.) Challenges will be identified, as this is the main concern nixing a similar idea earlier in the process. Appropriate research, implementation strategy and desire for success could implement this with much less controversy and pain than what we are experiencing now. Passionate and dedicated COULD implement it in time. It is incomplete. Any productive comments are welcome.

   Elisa,    

   Have a couple questions. According to this plan are we to build another Jr. High? Even if that was started now there's no way it would be done before next year. That leads to my next question, we still have a problem for next year so what do we do? This plan sounds like a similar idea that was brought up before and shot down.
    One thing I can tell you is your taxes for the school will never go down. Even if your value comes down the multiplier for the schools portion will go up.
    I thank each person who has "Donated" their time to help in this matter. I will support their decision and move forward to do what's needed to make sure each Teacher, Dean, Vice Principle and Principle has the necessary funds to take care of the education of our students. It would be nice if our own Government felt the same way.

   Option 4 with all 3 Aurora schools staying at Bednarcik is the best choice for ALL Oswego308 families (1st of 2 posts) -    

   These are the numbers from the proposal on Board Doc's from Monday board meeting – enrollment numbers for the future may change slightly once they get updated numbers from RSP –    

   - Bednarcik capacity is 950 
    - Current Bednarcik enrollment is 972 
    - Option #4 with HM, WC, WH staying at Bednarcik means - 
    - in 2012-13, it will be 939 students (which is less than what we have now) 
    - in 2013-14, it will be 984 students (which is around what we have now) 
    - in 2014-15, it will be 1072 students 
    - in 2015-16, it will be 1094 students    

   We can have all 3 Aurora schools at Bednarcik for at least 2 more years - As you know families don’t want to go down if they could stay. (Junior high students start lunch at10:29am, but high school students start at 10:49. Not much time difference)    

   No matter who goes down to Murphy, the district will lose property tax receipts / operating revenue. If you were looking to buy a home, would you buy it in Wheatlands Elementary area if it was going to Murphy? Or, would you buy it in Homestead or Wolf's Crossing instead? The district/school board is always under pressure to keep the tax rate low.

   Option 4 with all 3 Aurora schools staying at Bednarcik is the best choice for ALL Oswego308 families (2nd of 2 posts) -    

   If they send 1 of the schools down, the district will have less tax receipts and therefore less operating funds. That will result in cuts to programs or staff. In today's Chicago Tribune's Trib Local section, Indian Prairie 204 School District announced it is considering 110 layoffs, $1.4 million reduction in lower-level high school and extracurricular offerings, increasing middle school and high school athletic fees, raising technology and pre-school fees, on and on. Our district still needs to come up with $800,000 to open Murphy. Something has to give.    

   Either open Murphy with 1 of the Aurora schools, and lose operating funds. Or, open Murphy without an Aurora school at savings of $100,000. To me, it makes perfect sense to save $100,000 and not bring any of the Aurora schools down, especially since in the next 2 years, we can be at Bednarcik without even changing up the LRC space or adding temporary classrooms.    

   Consider Prescott Mill's analysis of drop in home value in the last 2 pages of the document,                                                                              http://dl.dropbox.com/u/984672/Prescott%20Mill.pdf    . If 503 homes drop about 6.46% in value, the district would lose $125,247 in revenue. The district money all goes into 1 big pot, and a loss at Prescott Mill or in ANY subdivision, is a loss for everyone else in the district.

                     More time needed to decide: Wait at least 1 year to send 1 Aurora school to Murphy - 
    Current enrollment at Hunt Club is 338 students, Old Post is 409, and Grande Park is 411. There are elementary schools in the district with fewer students than other elementaries so demanding opening up Murphy with same conditions as other junior highs, while I sympathize with Grande Park residents, doesn't hold water when it is currently not done at the elementaries that are already in existence.
    There is still much information that the Board of Education needs to in order to decide which Aurora school will go to Murphy - 
    1) Can Wolf's Crossing realistically be a walking school? Could this be accomplished by end of August when school year begins? What capital improvements have to be made? What are the associated costs? What are the liability issues? 
    2) What are the most efficient transportation routes to Murphy from Wheatlands, Wolf's Crossing, and Homestead? All Wheatlands students (including Four Points subdivision) can take Hafenrichter to Route 34 to Route 30 to Murphy (current high school route). Four Points can also get onto Route 34 at Ridge Ave where there is a light. These are very efficient routes. Starting point for all schools is Route 30 and Wolf's Crossing. Which routes from each of these schools/subdivisions would be most effective? If Wolf's Crossing becomes a walking school, it would be best to avoid Eola Rd and Wolf's Crossing St. (Continued)

    3) Relieving Bednarcik and giving Bednarcik manageable enrollment for the long term - Homestead is landlocked. However there are numerous unimproved lots in Wheatlands, and there are undeveloped land in Wolf's Crossing. Having both Wheatlands and Wolf's Crossing go to Bednarcik would provide much less stability to Bednarcik enrollment than if 1 of the schools - Wheatlands or Wolf's Crossing - went to Murphy. 
    4) There are differing enrollment numbers and projections given by the district. Board of Education needs to receive accurate numbers.

   A grand jury on Thursday indicted two men previously                                                                                                   charged with robbing a Naperville pizza place     – as well as a third man – on multiple counts of armed robbery and kidnapping related to crimes stretching back more than a year.     
   Travis Gamble, 22, of Oswego; Cory Paytes, 22, of Montgomery; and Josiah McCroskey, 22, of Lisle, are each accused of taking money, cell phones and other items from victims, court documents state. Each man is also accused of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery, records show.     
   The indictments do not specify where each robbery occurred, but at least two dates listed – Jan. 16, 2012 and Nov. 30, 2011 – coincide with                                                                                    Naperville police     reports of hold ups at a                                                                                                                Papa John’s Pizza     and                                                                                                     Domino’s Pizza    .     
   Gamble and Paytes were arrested in Naperville last month when they tried to leave the Papa John’s on West Ogden Avenue after taking money. Police, at the time, suspected the men might be linked to other robberies.     
   The indictments allege Paytes participated in robberies dating back to January 2011, some with Gamble and some with McCroskey. Paytes remains in DuPage County Jail on $1 million bail. He faces 10 counts of armed robbery and aggravated robbery and eight counts of aggravated kidnapping.     
   His next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 27, when he will likely be arraigned on the charges.     
   Gamble is accused of working with Paytes on at least three occasions where they, while wearing masks, claimed to have a firearm and threatened to harm victims with the bludgeon, documents show. The kidnapping charges relate to the men “secretly confining” victims, according to the indictments.     
   Authorities previously said the pair put employees in a freezer during the Papa John’s robbery.     
   Gamble remains held in DuPage County Jail on $300,000 bail. He is charged with six counts each of armed robbery and aggravated robbery, as well as four counts of aggravated kidnapping. Gamble is scheduled to be in court on Wednesday for arraignment.     
   McCroskey, who was recently arrested on an armed robbery charge in Willowbrook, was involved with Paytes on two robberies in January 2011, records show. McCroskey is being held on $120,000 bail facing four counts of armed robbery, aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping.

                              The 
top-ranked University of Florida womens tennis team blanked Pepperdine and 
earned its fourth sweep in five matches this season, as the two programs met at 
the Taube Tennis Center on the campus of Stanford University Friday afternoon.            
 
                                           
 
                              The 
Gators (5-0) won their 26     th       consecutive match dating back to last 
season thanks to taking an early 1-0 lead by winning the doubles point for the 
25     th       straight time.            
 
                                           
 
                              Junior 
All-Americans    Allie Will     and    Lauren Embree,     as well as sophomore    Sofie 
Oyen     won their respective singles matches in straight sets, while    Joanna 
Mather, Olivia Janowicz     and    Alexandra Cercone     captured three-setters 
to complete the sweep.            
 
                                           
 
                              It 
wasnt the greatest match for us, UF head coach Roland Thornqvist said. I 
think we all know we have to do a better job on Sunday (against Stanford). This 
season is a work in progress. We need to be tough. Thats how you win matches 
on the road.            
 
                                           
 
                              Will, 
ranked No. 3 in the country, was the first off the court as she defeated 
Pepperdines 72nd-ranked Ale Granillo, 6-1, 6-2. Will is a perfect 10-0 in 
overall singles matches this year and 93-10 in her career.            
 
                                           
 
                              Embree 
was the next off the court, defeating Khunpak Issara, 6-1, 6-3 and giving 
Florida a 3-0 lead against the 27     th      -ranked Waves (2-2). Embree is 
now 71-11 in her singles career, including a 47-4 dual match mark.            
 
                                           
 
                              Oyen 
provided the clinching victory with her 6-3, 6-4 decision over Ali Walters on 
court five. The win was Oyens eighth straight, as she remained perfect in dual 
match action this season.            
 
                                           
 
                              Janowciz 
dropped her first set against Megan Moore, but came back strong in the final 
two sets to capture the 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory. Mather then followed with a 6-1, 
4-6, 6-2 win against Lorraine Guillermo, before Cercone capped the dual match 
results with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Arianna Colffer on court four.            
 
                                           
 
                              Florida 
returns to action, continuing its two-match road swing on the West Coast, as 
the Gators battle second-ranked Stanford on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET. It will be a 
rematch of the 2011 NCAA Championship team final also played at the Taube 
Tennis Center and won by Florida, 4-3.            
 
                                           
 
                              Im 
very excited about the challenge, Thornqvist said of Sundays match against 
the Cardinal. Stanfords a great team. I think theyre healthy now. We 
certainly have our work cut out for us.

Rupp Arena went nuts, the Gators went into a shell.             
 
                                        
 
                           When 
things got hard, we were like this, Donovan said, clutching his hands as if 
tensing up, for emphasis. There wasnt any finger-pointing . None of that. 
Its just like everybody got into their own little thing.             
 
                                        
 
                           He 
called it a case of fractured minds, and provided a couple examples.             
 
                                        
 
                           Senior 
Erving Walker was not playing well, Donovan said. Hes trying to figure out, 
What can I do to play better? Instead, of being like, OK, focus on what you 
can control.' Its not about    you     playing any better.             
 
                                        
 
                           Erik 
Murphy was 3-for-11 in the game. Donovan: He misses a wide-open layup and open 
3-point shots. Hes like, I gotta make those shots. Well, great. I dont 
think youre shooting the ball intentionally trying to miss. But if you had 
control over it, you would never miss a shot. Focus on the stuff you can 
control.             
 
                                        
 
                           Its a 
concept the Florida staff has been trying to pound into the players' collective 
heads all season. The Gators seemed to get it at Ole Miss, falling behind by 16 
points practically out of the gate, before rallying for a big road win.            
 
                                        
 
                           Granted, 
the opponent was different Tuesday night, but that doesn't justify the 
"fractured" mindset.              
 
                                        
 
                           Its 
been our biggest issue -- the mental approach to the game, freshman swingman 
Bradley Beal said. Not being able to move past adversity and trying to fight 
through it.             
 
                                        
 
                           For UFs 
sake, the team better have made some progress on the whole 
focusing-on-whats-in-front-of-them thing. No, not a whole lot went right in 
that 20-point loss in Lexington, but dwelling on it will accomplish absolutely 
nothing for the task ahead. And its a formidable one.            
 
                                        
 
                           If the 
Kentucky game was the worst of the season (and it definitely was 
statistically), the next in line was an ugly 67-56 road defeat at Tennessee to 
open the Southeastern Conference season. The rematch should provide plenty of 
incentive for the Gators (19-5, 7-2) and demand their undivided attention 
Saturday when the Volunteers (12-12, 4-5) visit the OConnell Center for a 
showdown thats been sold out since early this week.             
 
                                        
 
                           What 
happened, happened, Murphy said. On to the next thing. On to 
Tennessee.             
 
                                        
 
                           In the 
first meeting, the Gators shot 35.7 from the floor, including just 7-for-22 
(31.8 percent) from the 3-point line, and scored their fewest points of the 
season. Since that game, the Volunteers have added 6-foot-8, 250-pound power 
forward Jarnell Stokes, who graduated from Memphis (Tenn.) Southwind High 
School in December, enrolled at UT in January and is averaging nearly nine 
points on 51-percent shooting and eight rebounds in 24 backup minutes per 
game.             
 
                                        
 
                           Hes a 
unique player just because of his size and strength. Youre not going to see 
too many high school kids that are seniors that look like him, physically, 
Donovan said of Stokes. Outside of maybe having to catch up and learn a new 
system, I dont think the speed or strength or size of college [basketball] was 
going to hold him because hes a pretty strong and physical kid.             
 
                                        
 
                           The 
Gators will have to deal with him, but they also have to deal with some 
shooting issues that are becoming too pronounced to ignore. Though first in the 
nation in 3-point field goals per game at 10.3, Florida has now fallen below 40 
percent (39.5) from the arc for the first time this season.             
 
                                        
 
                           That 
number is 35.8 percent in SEC play.             
 
                                        
 
                           Tennessee, 
meanwhile, is giving up just 32.1 percent from distance -- and no conference 
opponent has scored 70 points against the Vols this season.             
 
                                        
 
                           Its 
entirely possible that disturbing trend for long-range misses could continue 
Saturday. If so, the key for the Gators, however, is how they respond to balls 
banging off the rim. It needs to be better than Tuesday. It needs to be 
better than last month at Knoxville.             
 
                                        
 
                           We all 
want to perform and play well because we all think its going to help us win, 
Murphy said. But the reality of it is, success is going to come from playing 
defense, executing on offense and just playing together as a team on both ends. 
Thats what its about. Not a missed shot here, a turnover there.             
 
                                        
 
                           Added 
Beal: You just have to keep moving on. If [the ball] goes in, it goes in. If 
it misses, it misses. You cant get complacent. You cant be unhappy with the 
shot or whatever. You have to keep playing, keep moving on, keep shooting the 
ball.             
 
                                        
 
                           Keep 
tuned in to the next play -- the only one that matters -- rather than the last 
one.             
 
                                        
 
                           Or last 
five. Or 10.             
 
                                        
 
                           Its a 
lot easier to play when the ball is going in the basket, Donovan said. But 
theres no question there has to be a tough mental fortitude, where theyre 
going to move past all of this and find a way.

between Florida and Tennessee is a rematch of the Southeastern Conference 
opener for both teams won 67-56 by the Volunteers on Jan. 7 at Knoxville. In 
that game, UT shot 48 percent to 41.4 for UF and forced 15 turnovers. Backup F 
Kenny Hall came off the bench to score 13 points, with F Jeronne Maymon adding 
12 points and 7 rebounds, and PG Trae Golden 12 points and 7 assists. The Vols 
also hit 5-of-10 from the arc, while the Gators were 7-for-22. ... Tennessee 
has won two straight games, defeating Georgia and South Carolina at home, but 
is 0-7 on the road this season. ... Defensively, the Vols are one of the best 
in the SEC, having yet to surrender 70 points in a league game. ... The Gators, 
coming off their worst shooting performance of the season in a loss at 
Kentucky, still have all five starters in double-figures, led by junior G Kenny 
Boynton (17.6 ppg), freshman G Bradley Beal (14.3 ppg, 6.1 rpg) and senior PG 
Erving Walker (12.1 ppg, 5 apg). Sophomore C Patric Young (10.8 ppg, 6.4 rpg) 
rejoined the starting lineup last game after coming off the bench the previous 
six. ... Tennessee, led by first-year head coach Cuonzo Martin,  is paced 
by Golden (13 ppg, 4.6 apg), Maymon (11.9 ppg, 7.9 rpg) and freshman Jarnell 
Stokes (8.9 ppg, 7.9 rpg), who enrolled at UT last month.
