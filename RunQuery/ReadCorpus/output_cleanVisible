Nelson Nahim é pego na mentira por suas próprias palavras 
 
O vereador Nelson Nahim acha que o povo tem memória curta. Na entrevista, na rádio Diário FM, de Campos ele afirma que não me chamou de desequilibrado; que nunca propôs colocar a nossa mãe no meio deste debate político. Afirmou também que nunca me acusou de ter organizado um golpe contra ele na Câmara, com baderna no dia de sua posse (o áudio está na nota anterior postada no blog). Mas o que vocês lerão e poderão assistir abaixo vale muito mais do que as mentiras ditas por Nelson Nahim na rádio Diário FM. Reprodução da Folha da Manhã online
